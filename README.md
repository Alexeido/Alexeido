Hi, I'm Alexeido, an aspiring software engineer, with intentions of becoming a future cybersecurity analyst

I have several projects in mind for the next few months both to learn and to teach anyone who visits my github.

Next projects in mind -> Learning Unity, basics of cybersecurity and who knows if I will be able to get a certificate.
